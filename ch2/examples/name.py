# A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data.
# The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name.
# Every method is followed by a set of parentheses,
# because methods often need additional information to do their work.
# That information is provided inside the parentheses.
# The title() function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.”

# ALternative, but similar functions:

name = "Ada Lovelace"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
